    "The scenario is the following: we find ourselves on a distant planet populated by aliens. They seem to speak a language formed by two words, aack and beep, and we want to build a machine learning model that helps us determine whether an alien is happy or sad based on the words they say. This is called sentiment analysis, because we need to build a model to analyze the sentiment of the aliens. We record some aliens talking and manage to identify by other means whether they are happy or sad, and we come up with the dataset shown in in table <br>\n",
