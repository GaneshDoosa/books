    "Imagine that we have to take an exam that consists of 100 True/False questions on many different topics maths, geography, science, history, and music. Luckily we are allowed to call our friends - Adriana, Bob, Carlos, Dana, and Emily - to help us. There is a small constraint all of them work full time, and they dont have to answer all 100 questions, but they are more happy to answer subset of them.
